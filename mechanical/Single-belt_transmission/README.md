See the [Jupyter how-to](https://github.com/bgoodr/how-to/tree/master/python/jupyter) for how to using the Jupyter Notebooks.

* [single_belt_transmission_math_model.ipynb](single_belt_transmission_math_model.ipynb) -- Model the mathematics of a single-belt transmission.
* [total_sketcher_geometry_length.py](total_sketcher_geometry_length.py) -- FreeCAD macro to sum up the lengths of all non-construction sketcher geometries.
* [single_belt_transmission.fcstd](single_belt_transmission.fcstd) -- FreeCAD file containing the sketch of the single-belt transmission modelled as two arcs and tangent lines.
